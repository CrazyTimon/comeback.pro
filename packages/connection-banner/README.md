meteor-connection-banner
========================

A banner that displays when meteor server is disconnected with countdown and reconnect option


## Usage

{{connectionBanner}}

--

This package will look best with supporting packages `font-awesome` and `bootstrap-3`

![With font-awesome and bootstrap 3](images/with-fa-bs.png "With font-awesome and bootstrap 3")

Without either or both of these packages, it is still quite useful, but unstyled and plain

![Without font-awesome and bootstrap 3](images/without-fa-bs.png "Without font-awesome and bootstrap 3")

Element IDs can be used to directly style the banner if needed `#meteor-connection-lost-banner` and `#meteor-connection-try-reconnect`
